<h1>Causality</h1>
<p>Different aspects of how to answer questions about causation in general:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>philosophical</strong>: meaningfulness/notion of causality</li>
<li><strong>deduction</strong>: what are the causes of a given effect?</li>
<li><strong>causal mechanism</strong>: detailed understanding</li>
</ul>
<p>Statistics can contribute most to the dimension of <em>measuring effects of causes</em>.</p>
